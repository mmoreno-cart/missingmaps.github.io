&lt;p&gt;I first met &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/rhobis-story-why-she-cares-so.html&quot;&gt;Rhobi&lt;/a&gt; in a building site in Mugumu, Serengeti,  Tanzania, in September 2014 where she was desperately trying to get a Safe House for girls refusing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/&quot;&gt;Female Genital Mutilation&lt;/a&gt; finished before the “cutting season” started in December.  In the week we spent together I accompanied her and her team as they visited the surrounding villages, telling the villagers the dangers of FGM through debates, drama and dance.  Rhobi almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/rhobis-story-why-she-cares-so.html&quot;&gt;bled to death&lt;/a&gt; from FGM in one of these villages as a 13 year old and has been a passionate advocate for womens’ rights ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we bounced along the dusty tracks in a rusty over crowded car, frequently getting lost and stopping to ask for directions, I was frustrated by everyone’s complete lack of maps.  I had been inspired to learn about Openstreetmap at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Programme&quot;&gt;Wikimania&lt;/a&gt; London the previous month, and had even printed out basic maps to ask Rhobi to mark villages on before I visited.  That was a failure, as was my mapping attempts that time.  No one I met had a good understanding of where the villages were on paper and I was thwarted by poor connectivity and inadequate tools or understanding.   Later on my trip I was amazed to find my GPS at Zeze, and village of 9000 people showed a completely blank map.  I was 2 hours late visiting Ikondo School after driving round in circles through muddy rivers in torrential rain trying to find it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&quot;https://mozillafestival.org/&quot;&gt;Mozfest&lt;/a&gt; in October 2015 I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/eglemarija/&quot;&gt;Egle&lt;/a&gt;, a citizen science expert talking about mapping the locations of water points and other objects using &lt;a href=&quot;http://plus.epicollect.net/TDTschoolsResourceMap/Resources?Resources_key=&quot;&gt;EpiCollect&lt;/a&gt;. I told her of our need to map village locations. She was shocked to learn that the online maps were still so poor in places like rural Tanzania, and together we started &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Crowd2Map&lt;/a&gt;, a crowdsourced mapping project, using remote and local mappers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://maps.me/en/home&quot;&gt;Maps.Me&lt;/a&gt; produced their version that allowed edits into Openstreetmap we started using it instead, including developing a Swahili version.  We held a mapping party in Dar es Salaam, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ramanihuria.org/&quot;&gt;Ramani Huria&lt;/a&gt;, London, &lt;a href=&quot;https://technarium.lt/&quot;&gt;Vilnius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/MugumuSafeHouse/?fref=ts&quot;&gt;Safe House&lt;/a&gt; in May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve now recruited over 900 online volunteers and 199 local mappers.  In our 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1788&quot;&gt;HOT tasks&lt;/a&gt; in Mara region 696 mappers have mapped an area of 14,248 square kilometres and added 5 towns and 169 villages and hamlets.  We’ve also added 42,128 km of roads and tracks and 700,000 buildings..   Countrywide we have added 12,294 schools and  162 clinics to Openstreetmap from &lt;a href=&quot;http://opendata.go.tz/&quot;&gt;government open data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I visited the Safe House for the 5th time in  December 2016 I took out a printed map.  This, together with Maps.Me on Rhobi’s phone meant that when a phone call came in saying “there is a girl in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/4527206595&quot;&gt;Sogoti&lt;/a&gt; village who needs rescuing from cutting tonight” she knew where to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having better maps helped prevent 2257 girls from being cut this year.  However change is a slow process.  1076 girls were cut, down from 3700 the previous year, and 4 girls died, down from 12 last year.  There is an interactive map showing the location of FGM incidents &lt;a href=&quot;https://jachapman82.carto.com/builder/4324bc10-f250-11e6-9d00-0ee66e2c9693/embed&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Girls like Bhoke* forcibly cut at 13, her body &lt;a href=&quot;http://hiaragirlpower.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/5-girls-bodies-thrown-into-bush.html&quot;&gt;thrown into the bush&lt;/a&gt;.  But the tide is turning.  This year saw the first prosecutions against parents and cutters for FGM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Safe House sheltered over 200 girls this year.  Girls like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A2HB0XGHvs&quot;&gt;Jackline&lt;/a&gt; were saved from being cut and married off against their will.  Now she can pursue her dream to become a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is more information about this project in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/ajplusenglish/videos/873491619459013/&quot;&gt;2 minute video on Al Jazeera&lt;/a&gt;, and this article in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/06/online-mapping-tool-gives-fgm-runaways-a-path-to-help?CMP=twt_a-world_b-gdnworld&quot;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Local mappers are continuing to improve the map by adding the names of missing villages across Tanzania, but we are a volunteer run project with no budget and access to smartphones is a limiting factor.  If anyone has any unwanted phones we can make very good use of them!  Please contact us &lt;a href=&quot;https://crowd2map.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2016 was a busy year for the the American Red Cross and the Missing Maps project. Community-led mapping projects took place in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2015/03/29/riohacha-colombia/&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;, Ecuador, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/06/07/zimbabwe/&quot;&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/a&gt;. Our largest undertaking since the start of the Missing Maps project was in West Africa. Covering an area the size of Switzerland, volunteers in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone visited over 7,000 communities in an area that experienced the worst of the Ebola crisis in 2014 and 2015. Here’s a snapshot of what the volunteers accomplished:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/westafrica_stats_horizontal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quick stats&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A few West Africa stats at a glance. CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this project could not have been possible without the dedication of the Red Cross volunteers in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Over 120 volunteers plus an additional 109 motorbike drivers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2017/01/07/gps-tracks/&quot;&gt;traveled 72,000 km&lt;/a&gt; visiting some of the most vulnerable communities in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;«««&amp;lt; HEAD
We started the West Africa project in response because information gaps made it more difficult to combat Ebola. Accurate maps play a critical role in understanding human communities, especially for populations at risk. The lack of detailed maps for West Africa posed a problem during the 2014 Ebola crisis; contact tracing was much more difficult without accurate names and locations for all of the villages, particularly in the border areas.

We started the West Africa project because information gaps in available data made it more difficult to combat Ebola.

        &lt;blockquote&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;78b49549b3b4d6c305290133ba797e681473f62a&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
          &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mapping project involved five processes, which consisted of tech development, a mapping hub, a rapid assessment survey, detailed community mapping, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the field work, we estimated that there were about 5,000 communities in the target area (based off of OpenStreetMap data). When we actually got on the ground, however, our volunteers visited 7,000 communities. Planning and logistics were a real challenge for this project - here’s what 7,000 communities look like across the area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tech-development&quot;&gt;Tech Development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our standard mapping tools consist of Android phones, OpenDataKit and &lt;a href=&quot;http://openmapkit.org&quot;&gt;OpenMapKit&lt;/a&gt; apps, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldpapers.org&quot;&gt;Field Papers&lt;/a&gt;. These apps are cloud-based and most of the enormous project area lacked connectivity (data signals and wifi). We know this would be a real challenge; without a signal, volunteers can’t upload surveys and staff can’t monitor progress or do troubleshooting. To address this issue, we developed &lt;a href=&quot;http&quot;&gt;Portable OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; or POSM, a portable offline server. POSM enables us to do our full workflow offline and gave field team leaders a way to gather and push data in areas where there is no connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how POSM works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/posm_forblog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;POSM: more than just a cute name&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of our code is available on GitHub, so please contribute as we continue to improve our mapping tools! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm&quot;&gt;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/posm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mapping-hub-and-community-engagement&quot;&gt;Mapping Hub and Community Engagement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mapping hub was established in Guéckédou, Guinea, which served as an operations base and a community engagement facility. Local GIS staff used the mapping hub as a central location to clean incoming data and interact with the local community, building capacity in both the use of OpenStreetMap and general computer, technical, and language skills. POSM also allowed the staff and volunteers to trace features into OpenStreetMap in an offline environment. This process is highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://hi.stamen.com/merging-offline-edits-with-the-posm-replay-tool-2f39a4410d2a#.owg36t8sy&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Through partners in each country, local OSM groups formed to continue mapping communities both inside and outside of the initial project area:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rapid-assessment-and-detailed-community-mapping&quot;&gt;Rapid Assessment and Detailed Community Mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After initial training in ODK Collect and OpenMapKit use, the project began with a rapid assessment survey where volunteers visited every community within a distance of 15km of the Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone borders. The survey consisted of questions related to access to health facilities, access to markets, access to clean drinking water, as well as inquired about the community’s experience to natural disasters in recent years. These questions were used to create a vulnerability index for all 7,000 communities in the project area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the vulnerability index and major population centers, 104 communities were selected for detailed mapping; 26 in Liberia, 41 in Guinea, and 37 in Sierra Leone. Volunteers traced buildings and roads into OpenStreetMap and returned to these communities to map water points, schools, and and general points of interest. Using OpenMapKit, 300 health facilities, 400 education facilities, 3,500 water points, and over 12,000 points of interest were all added to OpenStreetMap. Data that was collected was reviewed for accuracy &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/workflows/blob/master/west-africa_data-cleaning.md&quot;&gt;(workflow can be found on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and uploaded to OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the data collected and the communities visited, roughly 800 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixme&lt;/code&gt; location and name tags were removed from the project area in OpenStreetMap. Many of what appeared to be communities were actually seasonal farms or long abandoned villages. Many of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fixme&lt;/code&gt; tags marked communities that were based on out-of-date maps and government data that was over 50 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the data we collected is available for use on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/american-red-cross-west-africa-project&quot;&gt;Humanitarian Data Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and on OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

Over those two years, the Missing Maps process has led volunteers to build out a better map through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;, and the vision behind it has become an integral part of how we as Missing Maps members approach our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since its launch in 2014, the Missing Maps partnership has grown from four original partners to a large and committed community of NGOs, academic institutions, companies, and most of all, individual mappers. Since our launch, we’ve added some amazing new members, all of whom have committed to the goals and ethics of Missing Maps.:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two years, we registered thousands of users and held mapathons in 47 countries! Many groups hosted regular &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/events&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt;, with mapathons held monthly in London, Prague, and DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;success&quot;&gt;Success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A highlight of 2016 was conducting extensive field mapping with local volunteers in the border areas of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/04/25/west-africa-mapping-hub-launch/&quot;&gt;West Africa&lt;/a&gt;. They completed field surveys in 7,200 villages and added health facilities, water points, and community resources to OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remote mappers played a significant role in helping save lives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/7a6df79c-c139-11e6-81c2-f57d90f6741a&quot;&gt;yellow fever emergency response&lt;/a&gt;, mapped data aided planning and logistics to vaccinate 700,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.missingmaps.org/blog/2016/07/14/mapswipe/&quot;&gt;MapSwipe&lt;/a&gt; app was also launched in 2016. Using fast satellite image classification on mobile devices, users can rapidly identify population clusters to better target mapping. So far, over 13,000 users have identified over 9 million features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thank-you&quot;&gt;Thank YOU!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing for us to look back and see how much we’ve accomplished together as a community. On behalf of all the Missing Maps partners, thanks to each and every volunteer who’s helped with the mapping and contributed to the project - we couldn’t do it without you!&lt;/p&gt;

Now that fieldwork is complete, we finally had a chance to look through the hundreds of GPX files that they recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was merging the many, many GPX files. There were 72,000 km of tracks recorded - equal to circling the Earth 1.8 times! Since the dataset was so large, the best way was to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ptrv/gpx2spatialite&quot;&gt;combine the files into a spatialite database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we cleaned up the data. This involved removing any GPX track points with a speed higher than 100 kph (which only happened when a staff member got on a flight and forgot to put their phone on airplane mode) and any track points that were floating in weird places (we had some points appear in Kenya and null island - these were from when the GPS on a phone was first turned on and was trying to search for a signal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mapped the data to see the full extent of how much ground the volunteers covered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;completing-the-road-network-in-osm&quot;&gt;Completing the road network in OSM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data aren’t just pretty; they’re also useful for adding roads to OSM. Several areas in the border regions have really cloudy satellite imagery and we wouldn’t be able to trace the roads if it weren’t for the GPX data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/trace_roads.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;GPX data lets us get underneath the clouds to add roads to OpenStreetMap (OSM). Track points are shown in fuschia. CC-BY American Red Cross&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the GPX data to complete the road network. First, I needed to figure out which of the tracks were for roads that already existed in OSM. I did this by downloading the existing road data and calculating how far each GPX point was from an existing road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to do this. I did it by downloading the country-level OSM-PBF file from &lt;a href=&quot;http://download.geofabrik.de/&quot;&gt;GeoFabrik&lt;/a&gt; (these are faster to download than shapefiles), &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AmericanRedCross/workflows/blob/master/converting_pbf_into_spatialite.md&quot;&gt;converting this into a spatialite database&lt;/a&gt;, and filtering the data by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;highway=*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPX data and the roads data both had to be saved in an equal area projection so that the distance calculations would be accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within QGIS, I used the v.distance function in GRASS. It’s slightly hidden. You can find it under:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Processing -&amp;gt; Toolbox -&amp;gt; GRASS -&amp;gt; v.distance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This iterated through each of the GPX track points to determine the closest road and the distance between the road and the point. I took the output and filtered the data to only keep track points that were over 100 metres from an existing road. This left me with a set of points that needed to be traced into OSM, which I did using JOSM; you can add in a GPX track points layer on top of existing data and imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three days, 8 episodes of Game of Thrones, and one sore arm later, the tracing was complete. Through the volunteers’ efforts, we added about 600 km of roads into OSM, connecting some of the most inaccessible and remote communities in West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past spring/summer, over 100 Red Cross volunteers conducted field mapping in the border regions of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. In addition to the actual mapping, we also asked the volunteers to record their GPS tracks each day, and we set their phones to automatically collect cell signal strength data using OpenSignal, an app which crowdsources this information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connectivity is very poor in this region, and volunteers often had to travel several hours to different cities if they wanted to be able to use their phones to make calls. By collecting signal strength data, we hope to make it easier for people to know where there is a useable cell phone signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the fieldwork has finished, we’ve had a chance to start going through all this data to see what connectivity looks like in West Africa. We haven’t come across much about working with OpenSignal data, so this post documents our workflow for using the data, the challenges we had, and our results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;getting-merging-and-cleaning-the-data&quot;&gt;Getting, merging, and cleaning the data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this project, we used 14 Samsung Galaxy S5 phones and about 100 Blu Advance 5.0 phones. We’ve tried a lot of different phones in the field, and the Blu’s are our favourite so far - cheap, hardy, easy to use, and they have a reliable GPS signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We loaded OpenSignal onto all of the phones before the fieldwork began, then downloaded the data at the end of the project, following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensignal.com/blog/2015/06/08/updated-data-collection-format/&quot;&gt;instructions from OpenSignal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenSignal generated three types of CSV files: wifi, speedtests, and cell signals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/file_types.png&quot; alt=&quot;File types&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we only care about the cell signal strength, I put all these into a folder and then ran a quick command in Terminal to merge them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cd [folder with .csv files]&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cat *.csv &amp;gt; merged.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting file was a little strange. First, the individual files didn’t have consistent header rows - some exports had considerably more columns, and the columns didn’t match up between the different formats; the Samsung and Blu phones exported very different formats. I split the files by phone type (Samsung vs Blu) and concatenated the two batches separately, then combined them and made the columns line up. This worked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was figuring what all this data means. &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensignal.com/blog/2015/06/08/updated-data-collection-format/&quot;&gt;OpenSignal’s handy post&lt;/a&gt; explained almost everything we needed to know, with one exception: signal strength was measured on different scales and had to be converted into a consistent scale. More on this below. (Note: there have been several updates to the OpenSignal app since we started the project, and the file structure may be different. We’ll play around with the latest version and post any updates later at the bottom of this post)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I cleaned up a few parts of the data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Timestamps are given in Linux/Unix epoch format, measuring the number of milliseconds since 1970. I converted these to a human readable date in Microsoft Excel so I could check how often OpenSignal was recording data. I’ve read that Microsoft Excel date formats are slightly different depending on whether you’re using Windows/Mac OS, but on my Mac I actually needed to use the Windows conversion. The formula for this is:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=(((X/1000)-(T*3600))/86400)+(DATEVALUE(&quot;1-1-1970&quot;) - DATEVALUE(&quot;1-1-1900&quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where X is the cell with the time in epoch and T is offset from GMT time, in hours. You’ll need to change the format of those cells to a date, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location-inaccuracy&quot;&gt;Location inaccuracy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum location inaccuracy was almost 5 km. I discarded any records with a location inaccuracy greater than 1000 metres. This seems like a very high number to me, but it eliminated almost a quarter of my dataset, dropping it from 200,000 records down to 150,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rssi-received-signal-strength-indicator&quot;&gt;RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) measures the signal strength. HOWEVER, it’s measured differently depending on the network type. For EDGE, GPRS, HSPAP, and sometimes HSDPA and HSPA, it is measured on a scale of -1 to 31. On other HSDPA and HSPA networks, it’s measured in dBm, on a scale of -113 to -51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other instances where we had “unknown” and “out of service” networks with an RSSI of 99. I wasn’t sure if this was code for “no signal”, or if it meant that RSSI was being measured on yet another scale - the internet tells me that the RSSI max is 99 on Cisco equipment. These records added up to only 1% of the data so I just discarded them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I converted the RSSI column into dBm in Excel in one fell swoop:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;=IF(RSSI&amp;lt;(-50),RSSI,IF(RSSI&amp;gt;31,&quot;&quot;,(RSSI*2-113)))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves values already measured in dBm, converts those on the -1 to 31 RSSI scale (the formula is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RSSI*2 - 113 = dBm&lt;/code&gt;), and returns an empty value for anything above 31.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I put this data into GIS, I coded the dBm values into signal strength categories. I found several different scales for this, so I ended up with the following “compromise”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-113 to -101: Very poor&lt;br /&gt;
-100 to -86: Weak&lt;br /&gt;
-85 to -71: Good&lt;br /&gt;
-70 to -51: Excellent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latlong&quot;&gt;Lat/long&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we set the phones up in the US, I discarded any lat/long pairings taken outside of West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gave me a clean dataset ready to be saved as a Windows CSV and loaded into GIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few comments about this data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It would be really helpful if OpenSignal data contained the IMEI number of the phone. This would let me sort through the data and group by phone, to better understand how much data was recorded on a phone, which might be split into several files.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Data cleaning would have been easier if OpenSignal data was set to export with consistent column headers. (Note: This may have something to do with the different phones we used, or may have changed sin new versions of the app)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The number of records seems really low. With over 100 phones being used for weeks and weeks, I would expect more than 150,000 usable records. This didn’t make sense so I calculated the interval between records. This didn’t make any sense to me - there wasn’t a consistent interval between pings, and it looks like several pings were recorded at the exact same time, then there would be a huge gap (hours, days) until the next ping. I didn’t find any documentation about this, so I can’t tell if this means that OpenSignal wasn’t looking for a signal (and why not?), or if there was no signal at all (which is still important to record), or if perhaps the phone was overwriting old data (but the file sizes didn’t seem to have a cut-off point, so this is unlikely). This seemed to be a major problem with using OpenSignal; the data would have much more value if we had a record every 5 mins, or something like that. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cleaned dataset (as a shapefile) and QGIS style file are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/e4piya18hburba0/opensignaldata.zip?dl=0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; in case anyone wants to play with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gis-analysis-and-data-issues&quot;&gt;GIS analysis… and data issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loaded the CSV file into GIS and converted it into an equal-area projection (to enable accurate distance/area calculations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the data look very sparse compared to the amount of volunteers and time spent in the field. The image below shows the OpenSignal data overlaid on GPX tracks collected by volunteers (shown in grey) for the West African region. The OpenSignal data covers some main highways across the region and some clusters in certain cities, but it’s extremely sparse compared to what I was expecting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The settings on the OpenSignal app explain, “Data is collected when the app is open and at a low rate when it is closed (around 10 signal readings per hour).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not what I see in the West Africa data. The snippet below contains data from a few different files. In each of these files, a phone collects data briefly when set up in late March… then nothing until a month later, at the end of April. When the phones are logging data, they are doing so at the expected rate of about 10x per hour… it’s just that there are huge gaps between the readings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://arcmaps.s3.amazonaws.com/share/blog-pictures/timestamps.png&quot; alt=&quot;time stamps&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;CC-BY American Red Cross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reached out to the OpenSignal team to chat about this and learned that the data collection engine had changed and a new app version was released around the same time as we began our fieldwork. We’ll play around with the new one and see how the data records look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next steps for the data involve turning the OpenSignal data into a raster (ie pixellated) grid that covers the area, turning it into a full-coverage surface rather than a collection of points. There isn’t enough data to do this comprehensively for the region, as we’d hoped, but we can analyze local areas where the dataset is larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we zoomed in to an area in the Eastern Province of Sierra Leone with a high density of signal recordings. We took the RSSI values for these recordings and then performed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/interpolating_point_data.html&quot;&gt;kriging&lt;/a&gt; using the inverse distance weighting method. What this means: we have a set of points and we want to fill in the gaps between them to predict what the cell signal strength will be in other areas nearby. When doing this, we set a distance limit on how far away the kriging will examine. Too small, and we won’t learn that much. Too large, and the results won’t be very accurate. Even with an appropriate distance limit, predictions won’t be perfect because we aren’t factoring in topography or other things that might affect signal strength. But this is still enough to help understand the gaps in the data for a local area. The output from the kriging is a grid of cells, each of which has a predicted RSSI value. This helps us to understand connectivity “hotspots” in the local area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributing maps like these would be helpful for local Red Cross volunteers and community members in general, who often end up traveling between cities in order to make a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These data could be combined with population datasets like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldpop.org.uk/&quot;&gt;WorldPop&lt;/a&gt; to examine populations groups with (and without) access to cell connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Emily Eros</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Red Cross" /><category term="Field Mapping" /><category term="West Africa" /><category term="connectivity" /><category term="OpenSignal" /><summary type="html">This past spring/summer, over 100 Red Cross volunteers conducted field mapping in the border regions of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. In addition to the actual mapping, we also set the volunteers' phones to record their GPS tracks each day, and we set their phones to automatically collect cell signal strength data using OpenSignal, an app which crowdsources this information. We haven't come across much about working with OpenSignal data, so this post documents our workflow for using the data, the challenges we had, and our results.</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">OSM GeoWeek Thank You!</title><link href="/blog/2016/11/28/osmgeoweek-thankyou/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="OSM GeoWeek Thank You!" /><published>2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-11-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/blog/2016/11/28/osmgeoweek-thankyou</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2016/11/28/osmgeoweek-thankyou/">&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your incredible efforts organizing this year’s OSM GeoWeek!

Missing Maps engages private and public sector partners to open data sets for use by the greater &lt;a href=&quot;http://osm.org&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; Community. Over the past two years, Missing Maps, engaged over 18,000 volunteers to make millions of edits to &lt;a href=&quot;http://osm.org&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt; putting over 20 million people on the map. Throughout our work we’ve constantly tried to figure out faster more efficient ways of using volunteer mapping time. Recently with the introduction of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapswipe.org&quot;&gt;MapSwipe&lt;/a&gt; we have a great tool to focus our mapping efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our humanitarian mission we are data omnivores, within licensing restrictions of course, constantly looking for datasets that can aid our mission and the larger mapping community. Collaborating with Facebook is an obvious step for us to take. Using the data created by Facebook volunteers will waste less time checking out a task to find an area with nothing to map. Currently, volunteers scan huge areas to find rural hamlets and villages to effectively map roads and buildings to prevent malaria, vaccinate for measles, or prepare communities for the effect of disasters. This mapping is not efficient and waste valuable volunteer time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data for Malawi was already used during OSMGeoWeek to help map over 1 million people in Blantyre, Malawi. And will help the Missing Maps partners better focus are mapping in the next few months as we strive to completely remotely map Malawi to support the many humanitarian projects there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook did a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.facebook.com/posts/596471193873876&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; about how they created the dataset. To generate the data, Facebook applied techniques from computer vision to satellite imagery. In so doing, they created the most detailed population estimates available to date in these countries. This effort demonstrates the immense power of artificial intelligence to produce insights for the public good. Read more about the technology side on Facebook’s engineering blog. In partnering with Facebook Missing Maps is making these valuable datasets available for free. Facebook provided data for Haiti, Malawi, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the data will always be available from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ciesin.columbia.edu/data/hrsl/&quot;&gt;Columbia Earth Institute&lt;/a&gt;. To make the data more useful for OpenStreetMap use we made a global &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/americanredcross/civoaaxp7001m2krvaz5rk1k3/tiles/256/{z}/{x}/{y}?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYW1lcmljYW5yZWRjcm9zcyIsImEiOiJzdHVRWjA4In0.bnfdwZhKX8tQeMkwY-kknQ&quot;&gt;TMS layer&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The next step in data analytics is coming to Missing Maps. Using the infrastructure we continue to build out on the Missing Maps &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/leaderboards&quot;&gt;leaderboards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/americanredcross/osm-stats-api&quot;&gt;osm-stats-api&lt;/a&gt; we are very happy to announce the creation of partner pages. Partner pages can be any sort of partner from some of Missing Maps corporate partners such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/partners/jpmc/&quot;&gt;JP Morgan Chase&lt;/a&gt; to local groups such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/partners/maptime&quot;&gt;Maptime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partner pages have several key features such as the ability to highlight specific tasks from the HOT &lt;a href=&quot;http://tasks.hotosm.org&quot;&gt;Tasking Manager&lt;/a&gt; and show the top mappers for a specific community. The site as with all Missing Maps leaderboards is powered by the inclusion of hashtags in the OSM commit message. Partners can customize social media links such as twitter and facebook. Partners can also maintain a simple calendar of events through maintaining a csv file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last and greatest feature is that the entire partner page is deployable via s3 or github pages. Just clone the partners github repo and make it your own, update the travis file and deploy. Because the whole site is built on Jekyll partner pages will look and act seamlessly with the main Missing Maps website but can be deployed behind firewalls or to unlisted urls if that is your thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to have your own partner page included into the main Missing Maps website just submit a pull request to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/missingmaps/partners&quot;&gt;partner repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;all-hashtags&quot;&gt;All hashtags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we launched the Missing Maps leaderboards we only tracked hashtags if #missingmaps was included with the commit. We did this to make sure our little leaderboard workers could keep up. Long story, we worked out a lot of bugs and we are now turning off the restriction of including the #missingmaps hashtag to track your project. All hashtags regardless of what they are now being tracked and can be searched and analyzed via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://missingmaps.org/leaderboards&quot;&gt;leaderboards&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to include your custom hashtag in your changeset comment when saving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each November, OSM GeoWeek serves as a time when teachers, students, community groups, organizations, and map lovers around the world join together to celebrate geography and make maps with OpenStreetMap, the free and openly editable map of the world. GeoWeek activities include both mapathons and field-based mapping activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-back--looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking back / looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year the Missing Maps members supported &lt;strong&gt;94 events in 32 countries&lt;/strong&gt;, and we can’t wait to see what the community can accomplish this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Red Cross GIS team has started planning with the Missing Maps member organizations in the US and Europe, as well as with our colleagues in DC at the Peace Corps, MapGive, OFDA, HIU, and local universities. We’ll be reaching out directly to a number of universities and organizations in the hopes that they’ll be interested in hosting a mapping event during GeoWeek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week presents a great opportunity for students, coworkers, or members of a community organization to participate in something both meaningful and fun this fall. Participants don’t need any expertise, just basic computer skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-involved&quot;&gt;Get involved!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your organization is interested in participating, the Missing Maps network and our colleagues can provide you with the information and materials needed to host a successful mapathon. If you’re located in the USA, then we can even send you a box of stickers and other swag as a care package for your event!

There can be few people more vulnerable than a woman in childbirth and her unborn baby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Danish, Swiss and British Red Cross are currently working together to support the Guinea Red Cross in developing integrated, high quality programmes, and the Reproductive Health and Rights Programme is one of these. It aims to improve knowledge and access to reproductive health and rights in the Moyenne Guinée region of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of Missing Maps within the context of the programme is to provide the detailed basemaps with which programme staff can effectively carry out a baseline survey to better understand the barriers that exist to accessing reproductive health services, and the prevalence of harmful practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accurate basemaps will also allow for more effective strategic planning around the provision of training and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;guinea--a-country-living-and-dying-with-the-effects-of-fgm&quot;&gt;Guinea – A country living and dying with the effects of FGM&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the West African country of Guinea had the 18th highest maternal mortality rate in the world – 679 deaths in pregnancy or childbirth per 100,000 live births, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.MMRT/countries/GN?display=default&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the World Health Organisation (WHO). For purposes of comparison, the number for the UK is 9.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant contributing factors in this high number of deaths is the prevalence of female genital mutilation in the country. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.unicef.org/media/files/UNICEF_FGM_report_July_2013_Hi_res.pdf&quot;&gt;According to UNICEF&lt;/a&gt;, 96% of women in Guinea have undergone FGM – the second highest rate in the world, behind only Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that, “Although female genital mutilation appears to be decreasing worldwide, this is not the case in Guinea, where this practice is widespread in every region and among every ethnic, religious and social group.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-rural-areas-and-remote-mapping&quot;&gt;Risk, rural areas and remote mapping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this widespread practice, many Guinean women are at high risk of suffering complications during childbirth. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2006/pr30/en/&quot;&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;, certain types of FGM result in an approximately 30% increase in the need for caesarean section, and a 70% increase in incidents of severe blood loss after giving birth. There is also a 15-55% increase in death rates for babies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its analysis of global maternal mortality rates meanwhile, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/&quot;&gt;WHO reported&lt;/a&gt; that, “Most maternal deaths are preventable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also found that, “poor women in remote areas are the least likely to receive adequate health care,” with poverty, distance, lack of information, inadequate services and cultural practices all being key factors in the reasons for pregnant women not receiving the essential emergency care they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;helping-to-prevent-the-preventable&quot;&gt;Helping to prevent the preventable&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tackle these issues, the Guinea Red Cross’ Reproductive Health and Rights Programme, aims in part to improve access to emergency medical care for women experiencing childbirth complications. It also aims to shift practices and cultural viewpoints regarding FGM, and to improve knowledge, rights and access to reproductive health in key areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme has been ongoing for several years, with the support of the Swiss and Danish Red Cross, and recently the British Red Cross joined the partnership as it enters a new phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this new phase of the project to get underway, a ‘baseline survey’ needs to be carried out to establish current levels of access and knowledge across six sub-prefectures. It will also be necessary to collect data in order to measure change as the project progresses, and upon its conclusion. And that’s where Missing Maps comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-mammoth-mapping-task&quot;&gt;A mammoth mapping task&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the baseline survey could take place, accurate base maps were needed of each area, and these were non-existent. So to carry out the extensive amount of mapping required in a relatively short space of time, the British Red Cross maps team in London turned to the Missing Maps project and Humanitarian OpenStreetmap Team (HOT) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team uploaded three projects to the HOT Tasking Manager, with instructions for volunteers to map roads, residential areas, buildings and other geographic features. Each project covered two sub-prefectures, and together covered a mammoth area of 777 square miles – almost 1.3 times the size of Greater London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In less than two months, all six sub-prefectures have been mapped - an impressive feat, and a testament to the incredible impact that the Missing Maps community can have when it works together. In just the six study areas – remote volunteers mapped 40,734 buildings and 1283 residential areas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the map features added by remote Missing Maps volunteers have been validated for accuracy, it will be combined with GPS data on village names and other local information collected as part of the baseline survey, creating a rich basemap that is accessible in OpenStreetMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The completed maps will then be available for project staff and volunteers to use throughout the programme, and will provide a vital geographic data source with which to visualise the results from the baseline survey.  More importantly, they will play an integral role in implementing systems which will help to ensure that pregnant women experiencing birth complications get the immediate medical attention they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without accurate maps – which can guide to a destination, highlight needs, reveal patterns and track developments - the work of aid and development organisations to save and enhance lives can be made even more difficult. Through the efforts of HOT and the Missing Maps community, large swathes of the world which were previously in shadow have been revealed, and the positive impacts of this are only just beginning to be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
